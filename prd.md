# Real Estate Marketing Landing Page PRD (Updated - Trust Narrative)

**Project Name:** Wiz the Planning - Real Estate Marketing Service
**Target Audience:** Real Estate Agents (Licensed Brokers)
**Goal:** Lead Generation (Consultation Inquiries & E-book Downloads)

## **1. Core Concept & Value Proposition**
- **Concept:** "Trust is the New Currency." (In an era of fraud, video is your proof).
- **Key Differentiator:** Building a "Trust Archive" through high-quality video content.
- **Narrative Arc (Ki-Seung-Jeon-Gyeol):**
    1.  **Crisis (Ki):** Real estate scams (Jeonse fraud) have destroyed consumer trust. Listings alone don't sell safety.
    2.  **Problem (Seung):** Clients are anxious. They need to know *who* they are dealing with, not just *what* is for sale.
    3.  **Solution (Jeon):** Video (YouTube, Shorts, Reels) is the only way to prove your expertise and transparency. Build an archive of safe transactions.
    4.  **Conclusion (Gyeol):** Start now to dominate the market in 2026-2027.
